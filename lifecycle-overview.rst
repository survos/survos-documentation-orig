Lifecycle and Workflows
=====================================

Workflows are a general way of describing a process -- what happens when, what are all the entities involved in collecting a specific type of data.

Entity lifecycles are more "under the hood" description of the specific state an entity can be in, and the mechanism to transition from one to another.

So workflows are the high-level overview of multiple entities, and lifecycles are detailed states within a *specific* piece of data.
